# Appliances-Energy-Prediction
Abstractâ€” The surge in smart home adoption necessitates improved energy consumption predictions for appliances to aid 
in efficient power management. This study utilized a rich dataset encompassing varied features: temperature, humidity, 
weather conditions, and occupant behaviors, aiming to forecast household appliance energy usage. The Boruta feature selection, 
a wrapper around the random forest classifier, was employed to identify the most influential predictors. By evaluating and 
retaining only pertinent features, Boruta eliminated redundancies. Post-application, a refined subset of pivotal 
features was discerned. Prediction models using this subset consistently outperformed models using the full set, 
underscoring Boruta's efficacy in bolstering prediction precision. This research emphasizes the importance of robust 
feature selection in enhancing energy management strategies in modern homes.
